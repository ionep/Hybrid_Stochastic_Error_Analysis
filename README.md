This is the library for analyzing errors in different parts of the Stochastic-Analog-Binary conversion step of hybrid split stochastic representation used in Pro-STAR. 

Files:
1. ErrorSplitMultiply - Calculates the error in multiplication of two stochastic numbers after splitting.
2. StoA_error - Calculates the error in Stochastic to Analog conversion (unused)
3. AtoB_error - Calculates the whole error in Stochastic to Analog and then, binary conversion.
4. error_result - Displays the resulting MAE and Max error of the above two steps without needing to run the entire code again.
